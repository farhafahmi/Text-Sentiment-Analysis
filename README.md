# Text Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains my exploration of text sentiment analysis using three popular Python NLP libraries: VADER, TextBlob, and Flair. The main notebook (`Task3.ipynb`) demonstrates how to analyze the sentiment of a given sentence and its individual words, compare results from multiple tools, and visualize the outputs as a heatmap for better understanding.

The goal of this project is to understand how different sentiment analysis techniques interpret the same piece of text. VADER (from NLTK) is great for social media or short texts; TextBlob provides polarity and subjectivity; and Flair uses deep learning models for more advanced sentiment predictions.

Inside the notebook, you’ll find step-by-step cells to:
- Import and set up each tool
- Tokenize the input sentence
- Run sentiment predictions
- Visualize the sentiment scores side-by-side
- Save the results for further analysis

This repository can help beginners learn how to integrate multiple NLP tools in Python, compare their outputs, and display the results clearly. Feel free to fork it, adapt it to your own data, or expand it with more NLP techniques.
