# Text Sentiment Analysis 📚✨

Welcome to the **Text Sentiment Analysis** project!  
This repository demonstrates how to analyze the emotional tone of text using three popular NLP sentiment analysis tools: **VADER**, **TextBlob**, and **Flair**.  
It was created as part of my hands-on learning journey with Natural Language Processing and Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to compare different sentiment analyzers on the same sentence, see how they handle overall text vs individual words, and visualize their outputs side-by-side.  
I used a sample sentence:  
> *"I really like you but you can be so dumb sometimes."*  
Each word is analyzed for sentiment polarity using:

- **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) — great for social media & short text.
- **TextBlob** — simple NLP tool for polarity and subjectivity.
- **Flair** — a powerful contextual NLP library using pre-trained embeddings.
